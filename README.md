French can be a VERY DIFFICULT LANGUAGE **cough cough easiest language I have ever had to learn **cough cough, so I have built this Flash Card application so you can study flash cards on the computer.
The application will automatically remove the words you know from the pile so don't worry about duplicate words(other than the ones you don't know but that won't be the case right?)
Once you are done go to the data folder and open the words_to_learn.csv file. 
Inside, you'll see all the words you FAILED AT and going forward, it will use the words from that list.
If you want to reset the data and start from a fresh deck, just delete that file and it will automatically reset.

*Please Note That This App Is Functional But Meant To Be A Joke, If You Actually Need To Study For French(which you shouldn't because it was ez and I learned it without flashcards in like a year), Please Don't Use This Application
